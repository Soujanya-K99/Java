Class: collection of state & behavior
class is a keyword, using it we can define our own user defined datatypes.
it is known as Template or bluprint of an object.
class Syntax:
[Modifier] <Class> <ClassName>
{
    Fields means variables
    Methods means functions
}; semicolon is optional

class Example:
class Student {
    int studentNumber;
    String studentName;
}

Reference variable:
Reference variable Syntax:
<ClassName> <referenceName>

Reference variable Example:
Student s;

Object: Instance of a class
Object Syntax:
<reference name> = new <ClassName>([List of args]);

Object Example:
s = new Student();

Constructor:
Here Student() means constructor.
constructor is an initializer method user for object instansiation and object initialisation.

stack|#code
holds the ref and hashcode-> memory is alocated for non static Fields
for methods memory is not allocated within this object
for every onject JVM created unique identity called #code or hcode.

Instance Fields can be accessed by using the object reference in static context in the same class.
// Instance Fields can be accessed by using the object reference in static context in the same class.
public class Main
{
    int x =11; //instance fields
    float y =2.5f;//static - within the same class and static context
    
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main t = new Main();
        System.out.println("x value is:"+t.x);
         System.out.println("y value is:"+t.y);
	}
}

Instance Fields can be accessed by using the object reference in both static or not static context in the other class.

class Test{
    int x =11; \\instance fields
    float y = 0.2;\\not static context since these variales are in other class
}
class Test1{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Test t = new Test();
        System.out.println("x value is:"+t.x);
         System.out.println("y value is:"+t.y);
    }
}

System.out.println()

Println() is a method used to print the satatements.
println is present in Printstream class. 
Inorder to call println we create an object reference "out" of static type in System class.
Since out is a static object reference, we can use classname to access it. 
Therefore System is a class, out is a static object reference of Printstream class to access println menthod in it.

Since out is a static object reference, we can either use classname to access it or use an object reference.
 since the constructor is private in System class it won't allow to create an object reference. 
 so, the only way to access the obj ref is using class name 


println is a methodout which is present in printstream class. 
we can access println method using an obj ref called out of static type.
since out is static type it can be used using class name to access it.
out is present in sysytem class.
System is a class, out is static obj referebnce and println is a method.

Formal parameters Vs Actual arguments
 the diff between them is they both are stored in diff memory. 
 actual is stored in object in heap memory.
 formal is stored in stack memory where the entire method memory is stored.

actual arguments are the original values that we pass by the calling method.
int total = a.sum(10,20); // actual arguments here are 10,20 the original values. a is obj ref

formal parameters are the copies of the actual arguments.
formal parameters are the local variables in the called method.
int sum(int x,int y){
    sum = x+y;
    return sum;
}

Instance methods:
 methods defined in a class without static modifier are called instance methods.
 Every instance method must be referenced by an object reference in the static context of same class.
 Every instance method must be referenced by an object reference either static or non static context outside of the class.

3 types:
mutable methods = changes the values of the fields =>setter method
immutable methods = doesn't change the state (values) of the fields =>getter method (reads the values)
initializer methods = used to instansiating and initializing the object => constructor
